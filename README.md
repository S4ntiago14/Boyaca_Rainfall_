# Rainfall_Boyaca
In this project, comparisons were made between three learning models: ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM-NN). Monthly precipitation data in millimetres (mm) collected from 757 different geographical points in the Boyac√° department were used.
